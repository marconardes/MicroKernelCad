     * other components like JSVGCanvas if not sufficiently deferred) that require a graphical
     * environment. This leads to a HeadlessException even when 'java.awt.headless=true'
     * is set by Surefire.
     *
     * Enabling this test in a truly headless environment would likely require
     * a significant architectural refactoring of MainFrame to separate UI logic
     * from component instantiation, or to use UI testing tools that can simulate a head.
     * The lazy initialization of JSVGCanvas alone was not sufficient to prevent this.
